### Research

Here are some projects I have worked on:

#### Sentence Representation Learning
- In the summer of 2018, I participated in [the Fifth Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/) at Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University. I was a member of the [General-Purpose Sentence Representation Learning Team](https://jsalt18-sentence-repl.github.io).

#### Multilingual Emoji Prediction on Twitter
- I took part in [SemEval-2018 Task 2: Multilingual Emoji Prediction](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17344) with Ted Pedersen. Our ensemble classifier ranked 18/47 in Subtask 1 English, and 5/20 in Subtask 2 Spanish.
- I am now improving the system with deep learning <span class="fa fa-magic"> </span>

#### Gene Selection for Survival Data with Glioma
- Within a pool of thousands of genes, which ones can be used to predict survival risks of brain tumor patients? In the fall of 2017, I conducted a biostatistics-centric [UROP](https://ugresearch.umn.edu/urop), investigating survival analysis and variable selection.
